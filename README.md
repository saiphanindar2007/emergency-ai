🚨 AI Emergency Response & Decision Support System

An AI-powered emergency response system that delivers
clear, decisive, and panic-free actions within seconds during emergency situations.

This system is intentionally designed to DECIDE, not chat —
prioritizing speed, clarity, safety, and responsible escalation.

🎯 Problem Statement

During emergencies, people often:

panic

lose time

make unsafe decisions

don’t know what to do first

Most AI systems respond with long explanations or suggestions,
which is dangerous in high-stress, time-critical scenarios.

💡 Our Solution

This project provides a panic-first emergency decision system that:

requires minimal input

produces clear, actionable steps

avoids unnecessary information

escalates safely when uncertainty exists

The goal is to support human decision-making, not replace professionals.

🔥 Why This Matters

In emergency scenarios:

seconds matter

clarity saves lives

wrong advice can cause harm

This system helps users:

act immediately

avoid dangerous mistakes

escalate to emergency services when required

stay calm in non-critical situations

✨ Core Features
🧭 Panic-First UX

Single focused emergency flow

No distractions, no scrolling

Designed for use under stress

⚡ Minimal Input

Only Emergency Type + Symptom

Optional voice input for faster reporting

🧠 Deterministic AI Decision Engine

Rule-driven, predictable, explainable

Designed for safety-critical use cases

🚦 Emergency Severity Classification

CRITICAL

HIGH

LOW

UNKNOWN

UI, actions, and escalation behavior adapt based on severity.

✅ Clear Action Guidance

Explicit What To Do

Explicit What NOT To Do

Command-style responses, not suggestions

📞 Emergency Escalation

One-tap emergency calls (108 / 112)

Triggered automatically for high-risk cases

🌬️ Calm UX for Non-Critical Cases

Lottie breathing / calming animations

Reduced urgency for panic attack & low-risk scenarios

🔒 Privacy-First Sessions

Anonymous authentication

No signup or personal identity required

🗄️ Secure Emergency Logging

Emergency sessions stored in Firestore

Minimal, anonymized data only

📊 Observability & Analytics

Emergency flow tracked via Firebase Analytics

Severity-level insights without personal data

📱 Progressive Web App (PWA)

Installable on mobile devices

Fast load and native-like experience

🧠 AI Decision Engine — Explainable & Safe

This project intentionally uses a deterministic AI decision engine.

🔍 Explainable AI

Each emergency decision includes:

severity classification

confidence score

human-readable reasoning

This ensures:

transparency

trust

auditability

predictable behavior

This is critical in safety-sensitive systems.

🔁 Gemini-Ready Architecture (Hackathon-Safe)

Live Google Gemini API calls are intentionally disabled
due to hackathon billing constraints.

✔ Architecture is fully Gemini-ready
✔ AI logic is modular and replaceable
✔ Live Gemini can be enabled instantly when billing is available

This approach is widely accepted in GDG hackathons to demonstrate:

AI design thinking

system architecture

responsible deployment practices

📈 Analytics & Observability (Google Tooling)

The system uses Firebase Analytics to track:

Emergency session start

Severity distribution

AI decision generation

Emergency call escalation events

All analytics are:

anonymous

privacy-preserving

used only for system improvement
