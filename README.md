# AI Emergency Assistant 🚨

An AI-powered emergency response assistant that provides
clear, immediate, life-saving guidance during emergencies
with minimal user input and panic-free UX.

---

## 🔥 Why this matters

In emergency situations, panic and confusion cost time.
This system is designed to deliver **decisive actions**
within seconds — not chat, not suggestions.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- Panic-first UX (single-flow emergency handling)
- Minimal input (type + symptom only)
- Deterministic AI decision engine
- Emergency severity classification (CRITICAL / HIGH / LOW)
- Clear **Do / Do Not** guidance
- Emergency call CTAs (108 / 112)
- Calm animations for non-critical situations
- Anonymous user sessions (no signup friction)
- Emergency data securely stored in Firestore

---

## 🧠 AI Decision Engine (Important)

This project uses a **deterministic AI decision engine**
to generate emergency guidance.

> Live Gemini API calls are intentionally disabled due to
> hackathon billing constraints.

### 🔁 Gemini-Ready Architecture
- The system is architected for Google Gemini integration
- AI logic is structured, explainable, and replaceable
- Live Gemini API can be enabled instantly when billing is available

This approach is commonly accepted in GDG hackathons
to demonstrate AI design and decision logic safely.
